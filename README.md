***Welcome to The Super Tiny Compiler!***

This is a Ruby version of [The Super Tiny Compiler](https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler) originally developed in JavaScript by [@thejameskyle](https://github.com/thejameskyle)

As of the current version (October 2016) this is a straight port of the JS code. The result is some non-idiomatic Ruby code. I might revise it to be more Rubyish, but for now it is what it is.

### Why?

I like Ruby, and I wanted to learn more about compilers and abstract syntax trees. I figured porting the code to Ruby would be a fun learning experience. I don't imagine this will have any practical use. :)

### Tests

Run with `rspec`
